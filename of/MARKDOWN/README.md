Look, some *italics!* So emphatic.

That's a **bold** statement, to be sure!

## Now for a bulleted list (Heading 2)

* list item 1
* another list item
* and another list item

You have to draw the line somewhere:

---

And sometimes --- you wouldn't believe it --- an em dash (*This isn't supported by all markdown processors.*)

### A fancy *numbered* list (Heading 3)

1. Numbered list item
1. Another numbered list item
1. Yup, *another* numbered list item
1. Note that I can use a "1." for every list item, and it automatically numbers the list for me!

Can you spot the `{inline code}` surrounded by backticks?

What about the triple backtick **code block** below?

``` html
<p>
  They've got me surrounded!
</p>
```

What if we put some of this in a beautiful table?

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ------------|
| *       | lists; italics |
| ``      | inline code |
| etc...  | you get the idea |
